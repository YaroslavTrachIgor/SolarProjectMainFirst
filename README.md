The project is divided into 4 parts - Menu, News, Reminders, Settings.

### Menu
In the menu tab on the first screen, you can find a list of articles and a carousel of photos. You can go to each article by clicking on the cell, where you can find the full article and change the content type, as well as change its font and share. You can also click on each picture in the carousel and go to a separate controller with a large picture with a button with a cross to close the screen. 

### News
There are two sections in the news tab on the first screen. The first section is a link to the site where the news content was taken from. The second session contains cells with the news itself. By clicking on the cell, you can open the full screen with the фкешсду itself, its name, the date when the article was written and a picture. As in the first section, you can change the font of the article content and share it.

### Reminders
In the Reminders tab, you can write short reminders about what you want to read or about something else. You can add a reminder using the ADD button. You can write a note in the field at the top of the screen where it will say "Enter here your reminder". You can delete the reminder by swiping the cell to the left, after which a small screen with the Delete and Done buttons will open. By clicking on the Delete button, the note will be erased and cannot be returned. By clicking on the Done button, the note will be transferred to the section with completed reminders.

### Settings
In the settings tab, you can go to different tabs to change your account, permissions, notifications, as well as read detailed information about the application. On the permission screen, you can give access to some specific system functions permission to use them in the application. In the account tab, you can create your own reader account, where you can enter your name, mail, phone number and more. In the Settings section, there is the Articles Notifications cell where you can enable or disable notifications in the application.
